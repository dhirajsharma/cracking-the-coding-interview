Chapters where problems (I plan to) go through include:

1. Arrays and Strings
2. Linked Lists
3. Stacks and Queues
4. Trees and Graphs
5. Bit Manipulation
6. Math and Logic Puzzles
7. Object-oriented Design
8. Recursion and Dynamic Programming
9. System Design and Scalability
10. Sorting and Searching
11. Testing

I'm going through the book, [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) to brush up and improve on my data structures and algorithms. So far, the book is _excellent_, and I recommend it highly! Lastly, I occasionally stream my progress on [livecoding.tv](https://www.livecoding.tv/allanbreyes/).
